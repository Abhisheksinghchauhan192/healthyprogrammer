
🌟  Wellness Terminal App for Healthy Screen Time!  🌟

As students, professionals, and tech enthusiasts, we all spend countless hours glued to our screens, whether it's for studying, coding, or working. But let's face it—long hours without breaks take a toll on our health. From strained eyes and back pain to forgetting to hydrate ourselves, we often overlook the importance of self-care.

🚀 That's why I built  Healthify Terminal , a Python-based app for **Linux users**! 🚀

🖥️ **What does it do?**
- Reminds you to take **eye exercises** at regular intervals.
- Sends notifications to **drink water**.
- Encourages you to take short **physical exercise breaks** to keep your posture in check.
  
✨ **Cool Features:**
- Pauses any playing media until you confirm the activity is done (status update required before resuming!).
- Logs your completed activities (eye exercises, hydration, and exercises) with **timestamps** so you can track your progress later.
  
This app is **lightweight, easy-to-use**, and designed with well-being in mind! Whether you're grinding through code or working long hours, this is a must-have to maintain your health. 💻👁️💪💧

**Built with:** Python 🐍  
**Platform:** Linux 🐧

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback! Let’s promote healthy working habits while still staying productive. 🙌
